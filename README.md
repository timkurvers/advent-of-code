> [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an Advent calendar of small
> programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be
> solved in any programming language you like.

This repository contains my Advent of Code solutions in:

- [JavaScript](js/) - all available editions
- [Rust](rust/) - slowly exploring the language ðŸ¥³

All puzzle, example and input data is normalized in the `puzzles`-folder so that
it can be used regardless of target language. This puzzle data is intellectual
property of Advent of Code / its creator [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz).
